       Originall in the early 2010s, this website began as a publicly accessible home for interviews and witness seminars on environmental dangers, but is now being transformed into a platform for stories, history, and teaching about environmental and climate justice, also the cumulative impacts and risks faced by environmental justice communities.

        Working with Christopher Sellers and Mark Chambers for the last 6 years, I've played a key role in the site's development, focusing on enhancing aesthetics and user navigation. I also implemented backend functionality that empowers professors to create diverse content easily. My most significant contribution was the 'visual transcript' system for witness seminars; this feature allows users to search the text and click on specific segments to jump directly to that timestamp in the video. Additionally, I developed a custom plugin that enables dynamic background image changes for individual pages. You can visit it <a href="https://envirodangers.studies.stonybrook.edu/wordpress/envirodangers/port-arthur-tx-witness-seminar/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">here</a>.
